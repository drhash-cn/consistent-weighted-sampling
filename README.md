# consistent-weighted-sampling
The weighted MinHash algorithms based on Consistent Weighted Sampling

The algorithms convert each weighted set into the hashcode for similarity-based data mining and machine learning tasks, e.g., classification, retreival, etc., by pairwise Hamming similarity calculation between the hashcodes.

Here, we develop three algorithms
